This is the code repository for [Building Web Applications with Spring MVC [Video]](https://prod.packtpub.com/in/web-development/building-web-applications-spring-mvc-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Based on an example of an online e-commerce chocolate store, this video course helps you learn the concepts of MVC and utilize the rich support of the Spring MVC framework to build dynamic web applications. You start by installing the Spring Tool Suite IDE and creating your first Spring MVC application. Next, you will learn how to integrate the model and business services to add functionality to the application. You then move on to learn about the process of creating a product catalogue and how to develop the user registration page functionality. You will then proceed to create an e-commerce shopping cart that helps users place orders and then implement constraints for the process. Finally, you will learn how to use Freemarker (a template engine for the Java platform) and Apache Tiles (a template composition framework) and design a RESTful API to implement the ordering functionality as a REST web service.
